  title: Beetle Eggs (Soil)
  description: '   Adult coleoptera lay their eggs underground, where the resulting
    offspring will spend most of their life. Parasitoids dig through the soil and
    deposit their eggs inside of the beetle eggs. The parasitoid larvae will then
    eat the yolk of the beetle egg from the inside.'
