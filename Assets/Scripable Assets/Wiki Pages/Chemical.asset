  description: "   Special parasitoids use chemicals to aid in the parasitization
    process.\n   Paralytic venom temporarily paralyzes hosts, giving wasps the freedom
    to lay their eggs without worrying about hosts running/fighting back.\n   A symbiotic
    endogenous virus, deposited with the eggs, is used to weaken the host's immune
    system, and increase the egg survival rate."
