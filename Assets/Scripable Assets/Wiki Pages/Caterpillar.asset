  title: Caterpillar
  description: "   Lepidoptera larvae spend all of their time eating, making these
    insects large and dangerous for parasitoids to approach. They are known to fight
    back, or drop down from leaves to avoid predators. \n   They make excellent hosts
    for parasitoids, due to their large size, providing lots of sustenance for host
    offspring."
