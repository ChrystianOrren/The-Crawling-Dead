  title: Spider
  description: '   Araneae spend their time on their web, waiting for the web to
    catch prey for them. Parasitoids can infiltrate this home and lay their eggs
    on the spider. Once the larva hatches, it hijacks the spider''s "senses", making
    the spider spin a special web cocoon. This cocoon protects the larva as it eats
    the spider and pupates, helping it to reach its adult stage harm free.'
