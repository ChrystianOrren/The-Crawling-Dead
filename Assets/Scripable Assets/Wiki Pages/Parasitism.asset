  description: "   Parasitoids can either lay their eggs inside, endoparasitic, or
    outside, ectoparasitic, of hosts. \n   Endoparasitoids are normally koinobiont,
    which helps with the limited resources a host's body has.\n   Likewise, ectoparasitoids
    are normally idiobiont, keeping hosts dormant to avoid damage to the eggs that
    are outside of the host."
