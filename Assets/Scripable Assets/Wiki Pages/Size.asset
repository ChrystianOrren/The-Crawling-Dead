  description: '   Size affects many areas of a parasitoid''s life. Small parasitoids
    are able to parasitize smaller hosts, as they need less nutrients to survive.
    However, larger hosts are known to produce larger parasitoids, and mothers prefer
    to lay female eggs in larger hosts because it helps with reproductivity.'
